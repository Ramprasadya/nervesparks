Note: The provided API is for demonstration purposes and does not have any actual functionality. The simulateAsyncOperation function inside the code simulates an asynchronous operation that always throws an error for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this function with actual database queries or API calls to handle real data and logic.
